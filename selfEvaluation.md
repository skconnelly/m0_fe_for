# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

`for` statements and I are not best friends yet. I had a LOT of trouble working through the `for` statement practice and challenge questions. I am so thankful that Nikki was in office hours to help; without external help, I don't think I would have been able to work through those problems. 

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

It felt super uncomfortable at first. However, after Nikki pointed out some basics about where I should input my logic (i.e. keeping logic within the curly brackets), things made a lot more sense. Without the external help, I was aimlessly changing things, and it felt very unproductive. The productive struggle came into play after Nikki had showed me how to do one of the challenge questions. After realizing how some of the methods worked, I was able to get some more traction working independently. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to finish my work for the day, and thats really where my head is at, before I start backtracking. My calendar has been adjusted so that I am working later into the evening. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't fully understand all of the methods (like `.push()` and `.unshift()`). I was hoping to go over those in office hours, but I am prioritizing the work that I need to turn in, rather than obsessing over minutia.
